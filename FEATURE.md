# ðŸš€ WebRover: Future Roadmap

## Vision
WebRover aims to become the go-to library for generating high-quality, domain-specific datasets for deep learning and AI models. Our goal is to make dataset creation as simple and powerful as possible at NO COST.

---

## Planned Features

### 1. Specialized Dataset Generation
```python
rover = WebRover()
rover.scrape_for_model(
    model_type="transformer",
    data_requirements={
        "min_text_length": 1000,
        "languages": ["en"],
        "topics": ["AI research"],
        "quality_threshold": 0.8
    }
)
```
- Pre-configured settings for different model types
- Quality metrics tailored to specific AI tasks
- Multi-language support
- Domain-specific content filtering

### 2. Advanced Data Quality Controls
```python
rover.set_quality_filters(
    min_words=500,
    required_sections=["abstract", "methodology", "results"],
    exclude_domains=["blog.", "forum."],
    language_check="academic"
)
```
- Content quality scoring
- Academic vs. casual content detection
- Duplicate content detection
- Source credibility checking

### 3. ML Framework Integration
```python
rover.export_dataset(
    format="huggingface",  # or "tensorflow", "pytorch", "keras"
    task="text-classification",
    split_ratio=[0.8, 0.1, 0.1]  # train/val/test
)
```
- Direct integration with popular ML frameworks
- Automatic dataset splitting
- Format conversion utilities
- Pre-processing pipelines

### 4. Smart Topic Expansion
```python
rover.expand_topics(
    seed_topic="machine learning",
    depth=2,  # How far to branch out
    min_relevance=0.85  # Semantic similarity threshold
)
```
- Semantic topic expansion
- Related topic discovery
- Topic clustering
- Trend analysis

### 5. Data Augmentation
```python
rover.augment_dataset(
    techniques=[
        "paraphrase",
        "translation",
        "synonym_replacement"
    ],
    multiplier=2.0
)
```
- Text augmentation
- Cross-lingual augmentation
- Domain-specific augmentation
- Quality-preserving transformations
